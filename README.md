# 3DCharacterController
3D Character Controller in Unity Game Engine</br>
Huge thanks to [Brackeys](https://www.youtube.com/c/Brackeys) for providing some of the code.


# Motivation
I created this project so I can start designing terrains in Unity Game Engine and explore them on foot with a Character Controller. Next I will add animations, combat, items and inventory, and other basic RPG features.


# How to use?
Download the Package file and open your Unity project.
- Drag Package file into your Project.
- Import all file contents via the Package Manager popup.
- Drag Player Prefab onto your scene.
- Run the project.

</br>Extra step to configure jumpable terrain:
- Select your Terrain and in the inspector create a new Layer named Ground.
- Select your Player Prefab and in the Inspector locate the Script Component.
- In the Script Component set the Ground Mask to the new Layer you created.
